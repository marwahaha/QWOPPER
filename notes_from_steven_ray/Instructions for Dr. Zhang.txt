Dr. Gordon and Dr. Zhang,

If you would like to run the GA on QWOP, import this project into an IDE (I used Eclipse) and run the class Genetic(). 
Most of the code I wrote for Vaucher's program is contained in that class. I made tweaks to the controller in other places, 
mostly for exception handling and bug fixing.

QWOP must be fully visible in your browser when you execute it, otherwise the program will not be able to find the game.

To efficiently test individual runners, or generate single random individuals, you can run the executable jar file 'qwopper.'
